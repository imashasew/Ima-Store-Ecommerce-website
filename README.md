I developed a modern and responsive eCommerce website using React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. The platform provides a seamless shopping experience with intuitive navigation, dynamic product listings, secure authentication, and an optimized checkout process. The frontend, built with React and Tailwind CSS, ensures a fast and visually appealing UI, while Node.js handles backend operations, including user authentication, order management, and API integrations. The system also features a cart functionality, payment gateway integration, and an admin dashboard for product and order management.
